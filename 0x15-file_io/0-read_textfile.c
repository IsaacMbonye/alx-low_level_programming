/*On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at the file offset,
 *and  the  file  offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.  If the file
 *offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are  read,  and  read()  returns zero.
 *
 * If count is zero, read() may detect the errors described below.  In the absence
 * of any errors, or if read() does not check for errors, a read() with a count of
 * 0 returns zero and has no other effects.
 * 
 *  According  to POSIX.1, if count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is imple‚Äê
 *  mentation-defined; see NOTES for the upper limit on Linux.
 *
 *  RETURN VALUE
 *  On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of  file),
 *  and  the  file position is advanced by this number.
